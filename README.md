# Introduction
You're probably looking for samples of my work. Since some of it would be better suited with an explanation and some of it isn't even on Github, I've tried to compile a summary here of projects I've worked on. This will serve as a spring board for your journey into the vast wilderness of my code and just what my purpose was for building it. Good luck and godspeed!

## TeamGrounds (circa 2008)
This is a project based around the idea of giving gamers a way to create profiles for their teams and connect with other players. I never completed it because another bigger opportunity presented itself, but got far enough where users could have profiles, avatars and friends. In the process I invented my own mini framework complete with its own ORM. I eventually learned that there were frameworks already out there and that writing my own wasn't really necessary. Oh well.
