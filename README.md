# Introduction
You're probably looking for samples of my work. Since some of it would be better suited with an explanation and some of it isn't even on Github, I've tried to compile a summary here of projects I've worked on. This will serve as a spring board for your journey into the vast wilderness of my code and just what my purpose was for building it. Good luck and Godspeed!

## TeamGrounds (circa 2009) - PHP
This is a project based around the idea of giving gamers a way to create profiles for their teams and connect with other players. I never completed it because another bigger opportunity presented itself, but got far enough where users could have profiles, avatars and friends. In the process I invented my own mini framework complete with its own ORM. I eventually learned that there were frameworks already out there and that writing my own wasn't really necessary. Oh well.

## CSS:RPG (circa 2006-2007) - C++
I built a game called CSS:RPG which was a modification to another game called Counter-Strike: Source. In its heyday it had 700+ servers hosting the mod with thousands of players. It was later featured in the printed edition of PC Gamer Magazine. To this date, the game has had 200,000 downloads.

## XionBot (circa 2004-2005) - C
Once upon a time, someone challenged me when they said that I didn't have the skills to build my own IRC bot in a low
level language such as C. I set out to prove them wrong and that's exactly what I did. The result was a working, modular
cross-platform bot that could be scripted with the PHP language. Needless to say, I felt somewhat vindicated.

## MumbleAdmin (circa 2010) - PHP and CodeIgniter
A client wanted a way to control all of his Mumble servers (VoIP technology) via a web interface. I built this small application to his spec which worked by communicating with the Mumble daemons through [ICE RPC middleware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Communications_Engine). He never paid me so I guess it might as well be a portfolio piece right?
